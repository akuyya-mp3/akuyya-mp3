<p align="left">about hating other russian people:<br>this is the thing that ive been trying to get rid of, but everytime i talk to other russian people, i keep getting left dissappointed.<br>it seems like all of them are the same, they're all racist or just edgelords in general. their repetitive behaviour makes me want to throw up and i just dont want to talk to them, since it seems like i cant keep a conversation with them without being filled with anger. <br><br>please dont tell me mean things over this because im not trying to be an asshole, thank you</p>
